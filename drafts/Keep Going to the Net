In his rookie year with the Vancouver Giants Brendan Gallagher started as the 13th forward (Fifth line anyone?) He finished the season on the top line.

Experts said at 5'-9" Gallagher was too small for the NHL. He was drafted in 2010 by the Montreal Canadiens in the fifth round 147th overall.  During the Canadiens training camp in January 2013, few expected Gallagher to make the lineup.  He finished the season 4th among NHL rookies with 28 points and was runner up for the Calder Trophy(rookie of the year).


>"I don't worry about the critics. People are always going to tell me I'm too small, or that I can't do something."

>"I don't think I've ever worked to prove people wrong. I think that, for me, it's been working to prove the people that supported me right," ~ Brendan Gallagher

Part of his job is to get in front of the net and battle against defenseman that are often 6" taller and 40lbs heavier.  Sometimes he battles two at a time. He has been described as a 'honeybadger' and an overachiever due to his size and tireless work ethic.  No matter how many times he takes an elbow to the face or crosscheck to the kidneys he keeps going to the net.  The guy is the personification of "get knocked down 7 times, get back up 8".

If there is something you want in life, something that is important to you, keep going to the net.

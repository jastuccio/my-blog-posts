# [Typography in ten minutes](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html)


this is a bold claim, but i stand be­hind it: if you learn and fol­low these five ty­pog­ra­phy rules, you will be a bet­ter ty­pog­ra­pher than 95% of pro­fes­sional writ­ers and 70% of pro­fes­sional de­sign­ers. (The rest of this book will raise you to the 99th per­centile in both categories.)

All it takes is ten min­utes—five min­utes to read these rules once, then five min­utes to read them again.

> Small but nec­es­sary in­ter­rup­tion: This on­line book isn’t sup­ported by ban­ner ads. It’s sup­ported by read­ers like you. If you find this tu­to­r­ial valu­able, see how to pay for this book. I de­signed the fonts you’re read­ing—eq­uity, con­course, and trip­li­cate—and they can be li­censed for your own doc­u­ments, web­sites, and apps. There’s plenty of other ma­te­r­ial too—see the ta­ble of con­tents.
Ready? Go.

The ty­po­graphic qual­ity of your doc­u­ment is de­ter­mined largely by how the body text looks. Why? Be­cause there’s more body text than any­thing else. So start every project by mak­ing the body text look good, then worry about the rest.

In turn, the ap­pear­ance of the body text is de­ter­mined pri­mar­ily by these four ty­po­graphic choices:

point size is the size of the let­ters. In print, the most com­fort­able range for body text is 10–12 point. On the web, the range is 15–25 pix­els. Not every font ap­pears equally large at a given point size, so be pre­pared to ad­just as necessary.

line spac­ing is the ver­ti­cal dis­tance be­tween lines. It should be 120–145% of the point size. In word proces­sors, use the “Ex­act” line-spac­ing op­tion to achieve this. The de­fault sin­gle-line op­tion is too tight; the 1½-line op­tion is too loose. In CSS, use line-height.

line length is the hor­i­zon­tal width of the text block. Line length should be an av­er­age of 45–90 char­ac­ters per line (use your word-count func­tion) or 2–3 low­er­case al­pha­bets, like so:

abcde­fghijklmnopqrstu­vwxyz­abcde­fghijklmnopqrstu­vwxyz­abcd

In a printed doc­u­ment, this usu­ally means page mar­gins larger than the tra­di­tional one inch. On a web page, it usu­ally means not al­low­ing the text to flow to the edges of the browser window.

And fi­nally, font choice. The fastest, eas­i­est, and most vis­i­ble im­prove­ment you can make to your ty­pog­ra­phy is to ig­nore the fonts that came free with your com­puter (known as sys­tem fonts) and buy a pro­fes­sional font (like my fonts eq­uity and con­course, or oth­ers found in font rec­om­men­da­tions). A pro­fes­sional font gives you the ben­e­fit of a pro­fes­sional de­signer’s skills with­out hav­ing to hire one.

If that’s im­pos­si­ble, you can still make good ty­pog­ra­phy with sys­tem fonts. But choose wisely. And never choose times new ro­man or Ar­ial, as those fonts are fa­vored only by the ap­a­thetic and sloppy. Not by ty­pog­ra­phers. Not by you.

That’s it. As you put these five rules to work, you’ll no­tice your doc­u­ments start­ing to look more like pro­fes­sion­ally pub­lished material.

Then, if you’re ready for a lit­tle more, try the sum­mary of key rules.

If you’re ready for a lot more, start at the fore­word and keep reading.

## Summary of key rules
* The four most im­por­tant ty­po­graphic choices you make in any doc­u­ment are point size, line spac­ing, line length, and font (pas­sim), be­cause those choices de­ter­mine how the body text looks.

* point size should be 10–12 points in printed doc­u­ments, 15-25 pix­els on the web.

* line spac­ing should be 120–145% of the point size.

* The av­er­age line length should be 45–90 char­ac­ters (in­clud­ing spaces).

* The eas­i­est and most vis­i­ble im­prove­ment you can make to your ty­pog­ra­phy is to use a pro­fes­sional font, like those found in font rec­om­men­da­tions.

* Avoid goofy fonts, mono­spaced fonts, and sys­tem fonts, es­pe­cially times new ro­man and Arial.

* Use curly quo­ta­tion marks, not straight ones (see straight and curly quotes).

* Put only one space be­tween sen­tences.

* Don’t use mul­ti­ple word spaces or other white-space char­ac­ters in a row.

* Never use un­der­lin­ing, un­less it’s a hyperlink.

* Use cen­tered text sparingly.

* Use bold or italic as lit­tle as possible.

* all caps are fine for less than one line of text.

* If you don’t have real small caps, don’t use them at all.

* Use 5–12% ex­tra let­terspac­ing with all caps and small caps.

* kern­ing should al­ways be turned on.

* Use first-line in­dents that are one to four times the point size of the text, or use 4–10 points of space be­tween para­graphs. But don’t use both.

* If you use jus­ti­fied text, also turn on hy­phen­ation.

* Don’t con­fuse hy­phens and dashes, and don’t use mul­ti­ple hy­phens as a dash.

* Use am­per­sands spar­ingly, un­less in­cluded in a proper name.

* In a doc­u­ment longer than three pages, one ex­cla­ma­tion point is plenty (see ques­tion marks and ex­cla­ma­tion points).

* Use proper trade­mark and copy­right sym­bols—not al­pha­betic approximations.

* Put a non­break­ing space af­ter para­graph and sec­tion marks.

* Make el­lipses us­ing the proper char­ac­ter, not pe­ri­ods and spaces.

* Make sure apos­tro­phes point downward.

* Make sure foot and inch marks are straight, not curly.

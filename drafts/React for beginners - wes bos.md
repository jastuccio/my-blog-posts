# React for Beginners

v1
v2
v3
v4
v5
v6

v7: props are how you supply data from one component to another

v8: Stateless Functional Component - for when you are just rendering HTML to the DOM.  It doesn't make sense to use
an entire React component.

v9: using React Router 4; basically industry standard. Show and hide

-----

v13 - covers state
React stores all your data in one master object called "state"

you edit the data, React will edit the HTML for you

### Updating Order State

Create a variables in Fish.js

`const isAvailable = details.status === 'available';`
`const buttonText = isAvailable ? 'Add To Order' ? 'Sold Out!';`

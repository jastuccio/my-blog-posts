# 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to the Chaos by Jordan B Peterson

### Foreward by Dr. Norman Doidge, MD

  * the foremost rule is that you must take responsibility for your own life. Period.
    * “if one wants to live a full life, one first sets one’s own house in order; and only then can one sensibly aim to take on bigger responsibilities”

>Stretching yourself beyond the boundaries of your current self requires carefully choosing and then pursuing ideals: ideals that are up there, above you, superior to you—and that you can’t always be sure you will reach. But if it’s uncertain that our ideals are attainable, why do we bother reaching in the first place? Because if you don’t reach for them, it is certain you will never feel that your life has meaning.”

### Overture

>“In a crisis, the inevitable suffering that life entails can rapidly make a mockery of the idea that happiness is the proper pursuit of the individual. On the radio show, I suggested, instead, that a deeper meaning was required. I noted that the nature of such meaning was constantly re-presented in the great stories of the past, and that it had more to do with developing character in the face of suffering than with happiness. ” ~ Jordan B. Peterson

### RULE 1 STAND UP STRAIGHT WITH YOUR SHOULDERS BACK

“Standing up physically also implies and invokes and demands standing up metaphysically. Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of Being. Your nervous system responds in an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily. You respond to a chal“lenge, instead of bracing for a catastrophe. You see the gold the dragon hoards, instead of shrinking in terror from the all-too-real fact of the dragon. You step forward to take your place in the dominance hierarchy, and occupy your territory, manifesting your willingness to defend, expand and transform it.”

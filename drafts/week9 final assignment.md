WEEK 9: FINAL ASSIGNMENT


Assignment
REQUIRED
Please complete ONE of the two assignments below. Your submission must include all elements of the assignment you choose.

Whichever assignment you complete, it must include the following:

Well written PHP and HTML that conforms to the WordPress coding standards
Internationalization of any text output in the front end or admin screens
Any hooks or functions you create must have unique names with prefixes
Assignments will be assessed using these criteria:

Meeting the brief in full (submissions that don’t do this will automatically fail)
Choosing the correct code (functions, hooks, classes etc.) for the assignment
Quality of code – it must be efficient, clearly written with comments and it must work!
Correct use of i18n functions
Extras – if you go beyond the brief you’ll get extra credit.
Assignment Option 1: Theme Templates and the Customizer

Create a simple plugin to register a custom post type.
Create a child theme of the twenty sixteen theme.
In your child theme, create a template file to display archives for your post type and another template file to create single posts of your post type. Make sure the template files are different from the default twenty sixteen ones in some way (e.g. in the way you display metadata, what’s in the loop).
Create an include file in your theme to add Customizer functionality, Create a Color section for the Customizer, that lets people change the color of one or more elements of your theme (this could be headings, links, anything you want).
When you submit your assignment, provide the following:

the theme files
the plugin file(s)
Assignment Option 2: Queries, Widgets and/or Shortcodes

Create a plugin to register a custom post type.
In your plugin, create a custom query to output the latest five posts of your post type (you
can choose what goes in the loop but it shouldn’t include the entire post content)
In an include file in your plugin, create EITHER a widget OR a shortcode so that users can
add your query in their posts or pages or via a widget.
Add parameters to your widget or shortcode so that users can specify how many posts are
output (and anything else you’d like to add).
When you submit your assignment, please provide the following:

The plugin file(s)
If you’ve created a shortcode, information on the shortcode and its parameters – in other words, how do I use it?
Please compress your theme files into a ZIP file and upload it below.

Your final assignment is due on September 15. This means you have two weeks from when this unit opens to complete the assignment.

After September 30, the course will close and I will begin marking assignments. Students who successfully complete the final assignment will receive certification for this course.

Good luck!

##Display

CSS treats HTML elements like boxes.  A box can be "block" or "inline".

* Block elements display on a new line (e.g., **h1, p, ul, li**).
* inline elements display on the same line as their neighboring elemeents (e.g., **img, a**)

It's possible to changn whether a box is block or inline by using the display property.

##Position
The position property is used to move an HTML element to a precise position on the page.

By setting position: relative, you can use the CSS properties top, left, bottom, and right to shift an element away from where it would have normally appeared on the page.

##Float
The float property moves an element to the far left or far right of the page.

For example, setting float: right pulls an element to the far right side of the page, and the surrounding text wraps around it.

`clear` clears float settings?

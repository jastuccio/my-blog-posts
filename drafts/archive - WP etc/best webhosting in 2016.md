You have come to the right place to get a recommendation for a good web host for your business

There is a lot of misunderstanding among businesses about how to select a host for their website. In every website forum I read there are lots os questions and complaints about webhosting. This blog post will begin to clear up all the confusion out there.

  "Sign up with us and dominate the internet!" Your  monthly price is less than a sandwich at a fast food restraunt and the value is even worse. Sadly choosing "Mega Host" because of their million dollar marketing campaign and dirt cheap rates is all too common. I get it. Web hosting is still highly technical and full of jargon that mean less than nothing to someone non-technical.  C-panel, VPS, SSL certificate, DNS, etc.

Let's imagine your website as a business vehicle. Budget hosting is a very cheap car. It gets you from point A to B, usually.  The air conditioning doesn't work so you'll sweat in the summer. It's rusted and dented, with a busted turn signal. People that see it get the impression your business isn't doing well enough to have a clean, modern vehicle. You better have your mechanic on speed dial.  The questiion isn't if you will need him, but when. But hey, it's dirt cheap right? Not really.

The first time you hire a web developer a good chunk of your yearly web hosting savings vanish. The extra time they spend because of your janky hosting erases what you saved very quickly.  Not long ago I was involved in a project where the web developer billed hundreds of dollars for project staging setup. There were multiple emails back and forth over a week between tech support and the developer.  This is literally a button click away on a quality, modern host. The slow page load speeds, long wait times for their "24/7/365" tech support( Im a talking hours), and numerous other problems make budget hosting a very poor value proposition.

Ok, you convinced me not to use budget hosting.  Who should I use to host my website? First you need to know every host has problems sometimes.  You will even find the occassional bad review for the hosting I am going to recommend. There is one question you can ask to eliminate hosting I have seen bombarded bad reviews.  "Are you an EIG hosting company"?  EIG is a giant company that owns dozens of other hosting comapanies.  People claim when they take over a hosting company they switch to cheaper hardware, gut customer service, and cram too many websites onto each server. 

A partial list of 'EIG' hosts.  There are many more out there. Avoid these hosts like the plague:

* A Small Orange (asmallorange.com)
* BlueHost (bluehost.com)
* Domain.com
* DomainHost (domainhost.com)
* Ehost (ehost.com)
* FatCow (fatcow.com, fatcowhosting.com)
* HostGator (hostgator.com)
* HostMonster (hostmonster.com)
* Intuit Websites
* Site5 (site5.com)
* SiteBuilder (sitebuilder.com)
* SuperGreen Hosting (SuperGreenHosting, supergreenhosting.com)
* TypePad (typepad.com)

In 2015 EIG acquired constant contact so you should avoid using them for email marketing as well.

Who you should consider for hosting depends on who you are:

**make a table showing hosting companies**

WP Engine – the originator of managed hosting
SiteGround – great product/service for price

medium to large business:
Pagely – great for scale on Amazon AWS
Pantheon - Your developers will love you

Flywheel – great for designers
GoDaddy Pro – great for those getting started

A blogger or small site that doesn't need 24/7 tech support:

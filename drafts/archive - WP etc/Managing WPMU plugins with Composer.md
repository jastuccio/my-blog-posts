# Managing WPMU plugins with Composer

###Super duper simple except when it isn't!

-----

## Create auth.json in `COMPOSER_HOME`

`$ cd ~/.composer`

`$ st auth.json` 'st' is my Sublime Text shortcut.  You probably want to  use something else in its place like `nano` or learn how to [create a sublime text shortcut]() for yourself.

**fix shortcut**

**add auth.json to global.gitignore**


>The COMPOSER_HOME var allows you to change the Composer home directory. This is a hidden, global (per-user on the machine) directory that is shared between all projects.

>OSX `~/.composer`

>'nix systems `/home/<user>/.composer`

>On "XDG Base Directory Specifications" nix systems `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/composer`

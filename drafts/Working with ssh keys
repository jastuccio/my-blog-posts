Working with ssh Keys

I use multiple ssh keys.  There does not seem to be a [consensus](http://superuser.com/questions/121307/is-it-reasonable-to-have-multiple-ssh-keys) on whether or not this is a best practice.  Since I already have multiple keys I am going to continue with that system.

associate the correct key with a host `ssh -i ~/.ssh/blah.key username@host.com`
